# Profitable App Profiles

In this project, we are analyzing data to find which free, English apps are most popular so that we can develop an app to make money through in-app advertisements.

We use data sets from the `iOS App Store` and `Google Play Store` which contain every app in the store, their sizes, ratings, prices, etc...

We use this data to find a genre or category in which we would want to develop an app for the highest possible profit margin.
